This uses the professor starter code.
The code assumes that the files don't end in an empty line. For example: If a file has only 1 line of code, then there is no second line in the file.
This code assumes that all the testfiles are in the same directory as the code.
A2-StarterCode directory contains the public tests given and some tests that we wrote ourselves.
